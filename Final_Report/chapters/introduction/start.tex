% In this section, we briefly discuss how to set up your thesis to work with the
% \acs{template} template.
% This is a four step program:
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item choosing a language,
% 	\item setting up the title page of your thesis,
% 	\item writing its abstract, and 
% 	\item writing the thesis.
% \end{enumerate}dfdfkjd

% The \acs{template} template can set up your thesis to use either English or
% German language options.
% By default, English is used.
% If you want to use German, edit the line of \emph{thesis.tex} that reads
% \verb+\documentclass[]{upb\_cs\_thesis}+ and write \emph{german} (lower case!)
% into the pair of brackets.

% What you need to set up the title page are a \emph{title}, your \emph{own
% name}, the \emph{type} of the thesis and the academic \emph{degree} you aim
% for, the name of your \emph{supervisor} and his or her \emph{research group's
% name}, as well as a submission date.
% Setting up your thesis's title page, by editing the main file
% \emph{thesis.tex}. 
% In the section marked ``your thesis title, [\dots],'' you find certain
% commands to which you pass the information listed above.
% Pass your thesis's title to the \verb+\thesis+ command, and your own name to
% the \verb+\author+ command.
% The type of your thesis is passed to the \verb+\thesistype+ command.
% You can comment in or out any of the example types given in the file, or pass
% a string of your own choice.
% Similarly, for the academic degree choose any of the given examples or pass
% your own choice.
% Your supervisor's research group's name is passed to the \verb+\researchgroup+
% command, while his or her name goes into the \verb+\supervisor+ command.
% The submission date of your thesis is passed to the \verb+\submissiondate+
% command; you can pass the current date via the \verb+\today{}+ command, \ie{}
% not changing the template file.

% If you already know your thesis's abstract, write it down in file
% \mbox{abstract.tex}.
% You can leave the file unchanged, in which case this template documentation's
% abstract is used instead until you change file \mbox{abstract.tex}.

% Finally, start writing your thesis.
% Your texts should go into the chapters directory, as described in
% Section~\ref{sec:introduction:folders:chapters}.
%The most crucial factor to consider when ensuring information confidentiality is %authentication.
